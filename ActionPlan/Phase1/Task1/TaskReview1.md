**Task Reviewed**: Task 1.1 - Initialize Project Structure

## Review Summary

Task 1.1 has been **COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY** ✅ 

All requirements have been met and the project foundation is properly established.

## What Was Done Correctly ✅

### 1. Directory Structure
- ✅ `/base` directory created with comprehensive README
- ✅ `/tools` directory created with clear MCP tool specification
- ✅ `/connectors` directory created with API integration guidelines
- ✅ `/config` directory created with runtime configuration documentation
- ✅ `/templates` directory created with code generation template guidelines

### 2. Documentation Quality
Each README.md file includes:
- ✅ **Purpose**: Clear explanation of directory's role
- ✅ **Expected File Formats**: Detailed format specifications
- ✅ **Naming Conventions**: Consistent kebab-case, PascalCase, camelCase guidelines
- ✅ **Structure Guidelines**: Example metadata and code patterns

### 3. Git Configuration
The `.gitignore` file properly excludes:
- ✅ `node_modules/` and package lock files
- ✅ `dist/`, `build/` and build artifacts
- ✅ `*.log` files and logs directory
- ✅ `.env*` files for environment variables
- ✅ `*.img`, `*.tar` Docker artifacts
