# Task 10.5: Create Quick Start Guide

**Goal**: Update main README with getting started instructions.

**Actions**:

- Update `README.md` with Quick Start section at top
- Add installation instructions: prerequisites (Docker, Node.js), clone repo, npm install, build generator image
- Include "first build" walkthrough: create simple tool, run generator, see it work - with actual commands and expected output
- Add common usage examples: build with custom tools, run server locally, test with curl/MCP client
- Include troubleshooting FAQ: Docker not running, permission errors, port conflicts, module not found
- Add "What's Next" section: links to detailed guides, how to add connectors, deployment options
- Include architecture diagram: visual showing generator → modules → Docker → MCP server flow
- Add video/GIF: screen recording of build process (optional but helpful)
- Keep concise: aim for "working server in 5 minutes"

**Success Criteria**: Clear quick start; user can build first MCP server quickly; links to deeper docs; addresses common issues
