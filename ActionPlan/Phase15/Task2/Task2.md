# Task 15.2: Finalize Documentation

**Goal**: Review and polish all documentation for release readiness.

**Actions**:

- Review all docs for accuracy: verify code examples work, links aren't broken, commands produce expected output
- Add missing sections: identify gaps in documentation, add explanations for undocumented features
- Create table of contents: add to README and each doc file, use markdown TOC, link to sections
- Add cross-references: link between related docs, e.g., tool guide → config guide → deployment guide
- Proofread and edit: fix typos, improve clarity, ensure consistent terminology, check grammar
- Standardize formatting: consistent heading levels, code block languages, bullet points, numbering
- Add examples throughout: ensure every concept has code example, show both good and bad practices
- Create visual aids: add diagrams for architecture, workflows, data flow using Mermaid or images
- Verify all commands: test every CLI command shown in docs, update if syntax changed
- Add version indicators: note which features require specific versions, mark deprecated features
- Create documentation index: single page linking to all docs with brief descriptions

**Success Criteria**: All docs reviewed; no broken links; consistent formatting; adequate examples; visuals added; index created
